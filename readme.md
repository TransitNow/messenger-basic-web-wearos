## Why Use This App?
- **Samsung Browser Limitations:** The Samsung Browser on Wear OS does not support adding bookmarks directly to the home screen. While it's possible to add a shortcut to a watchface complication, this is not an ideal solution as it uses up one of the limited complication slots on your watchface.
- **Compatibility Issues with Messenger Lite:** The Facebook Messenger Lite app, along with other Facebook phone APKs, have been found to have compatibility issues with Wear OS. For detailed information on these issues, check out the discussions on the [XDA forums](https://xdaforums.com/t/official-list-of-sideloaded-apps-and-workarounds-for-wear-os-tested-on-galaxy-watch.4379825/).
- **Voice assistant** support, asking Google Assistant to "open Messenger" which is handy when your phone is not nearby.

## Limitations
Samsung browser cannot navigate to the desktop version of Facebook or Messenger because the website detects it as a mobile device. It sadly redirects the user to download Facebook Lite instead. Hence, we use the basic web app version instead.

## Installation Guide
- Download the latest release from the releases.
- Install any Wear OS browser, Samsung Browser is recommended for Galaxy Watch 4/5/6 users.
- For installation, you can follow similar steps as outlined for other Wear OS 4 applications. Detailed instructions are available on my [GitHub page for Wear OS 4 apps](https://github.com/TransitNow/flashpay-wearos#how-to-install).
